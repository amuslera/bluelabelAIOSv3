# Documentation Reorganization Summary

Date: June 2, 2025

## Overview
Successfully reorganized all documentation files from the root directory into a structured `docs/` hierarchy for better maintainability and navigation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Directory Structure
```
docs/
├── architecture/     # Architecture and design documents
├── demos/           # Demo setups and walkthroughs
├── development/     # Development guides and standards
├── handoff/         # Onboarding and handoff documentation
├── project/         # Project planning and management
├── sprints/         # Sprint documentation and retrospectives
├── status/          # Status reports and progress tracking
└── theatrical/      # Theatrical monitoring documentation
```

### 2. Files Moved (58 total)
- **Architecture** (3 files): ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md, CONTROL_CENTER_UI.md, REFINED_ARCHITECTURE.md
- **Demos** (4 files): DEMO_*.md, MULTI_TERMINAL_SETUP.md, REAL_COLLABORATION_SETUP.md
- **Development** (5 files): CLAUDE.md, DEVELOPMENT*.md, INSTRUCTIONS.md, LLM_ROUTING_CONFIG.md
- **Handoff** (3 files): ARCH-CTO_ONBOARDING.md, HANDOFF_*.md
- **Project** (10 files): PROJECT_*.md, BACKLOG.md, ROADMAP_2025.md, IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md, etc.
- **Sprints** (23 files): All SPRINT_*.md files including backlogs, plans, and retrospectives
- **Status** (8 files): CURRENT_STATUS.md, PHASE_1_*.md, LESSONS_LEARNED.md, SECURITY_AUDIT_RESULTS.md, etc.
- **Theatrical** (3 files): THEATRICAL_*.md files

### 3. Updated References
- Updated references in `/README.md` to point to new locations
- Updated references in `/docs/development/DEVELOPMENT.md`
- Updated references in `/docs/development/CLAUDE.md`
- Created `/docs/README.md` as a comprehensive documentation index

### 4. Files Kept in Root
- `README.md` - Main project README (appropriately remains in root)

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Documentation is now categorized by purpose
2. **Easier Navigation**: Clear directory names indicate content type
3. **Improved Maintainability**: Related documents are grouped together
4. **Scalability**: Structure supports future documentation growth
5. **Professional Structure**: Follows standard documentation practices

## Next Steps
1. Update any CI/CD scripts that reference documentation paths
2. Update developer onboarding to mention the new structure
3. Consider adding more detailed README files in each subdirectory
4. Set up automated documentation generation if needed

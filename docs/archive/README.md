- **Sprint 1.2.5** - Bug fixes, stabilization, and testing improvements
- **Sprint 1.3** - LLM routing architecture and provider abstraction
- **Sprint 1.4** - Real LLM provider integration (Claude, OpenAI)
- **Sprint 1.5** - Theatrical reality demo and visualization

These documents are preserved for historical reference and to understand the evolution of the project architecture and decisions.

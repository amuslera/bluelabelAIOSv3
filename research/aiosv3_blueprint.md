# Project Blueprint: Modular, Production-Ready AI Agent Platform  
**(Hybrid Cloud-Local Model Routing)**

**Date:** May 30, 2025  
**Prepared for:** [Your Team/Organization]  
**Purpose:** To guide the development of a robust, scalable, and commercially viable AI agent platform that maximizes code/data ownership and supports flexible assignment of cloud or local LLMs to individual agents.

---

## **1. Vision & Objectives**

We aim to build a production-grade, modular AI agent platform that:
- **Orchestrates multiple specialized agents** (e.g., CTO, frontend, backend, QA) to autonomously deliver complex digital products and services.
- **Maximizes code, model, and data ownership**, minimizing reliance on proprietary SaaS or closed-source services where feasible.
- **Supports rapid scaling, integration, and customization** for diverse business and technical workflows.
- **Enables seamless integration with business systems and external tools** via open protocols and workflow automation.
- **Allows each agent to be assigned a cloud-based LLM (e.g., Claude Code) or a local/self-hosted LLM, with the ability to switch or route tasks dynamically as business needs or cost/privacy requirements evolve**[1][2][3].

---

## **2. Architectural Approach**

### **A. Modular Multi-Agent Architecture**

- **Specialized Agents:** Each agent (CTO, frontend, backend, QA, etc.) is modular and can be assigned either a cloud-based LLM (e.g., Claude Code) or a local LLM (e.g., Llama 3/4, DeepSeek, Qwen, Code Llama). Assignment is configurable per agent, per task, or per workflow[1][2][3].
- **Orchestrator Layer:** A central controller (or distributed orchestration layer) manages agent activation, workflow sequencing, and state/context sharing, and routes each agentâ€™s requests to the designated LLM endpoint (cloud or local).
- **Shared Memory & State:** Use external, persistent memory (vector DBs, Redis) to maintain agent state and context across sessions, supporting recovery and scaling.
- **Open Communication Protocols:** Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) for standardized agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication, maximizing interoperability and future-proofing.
- **Hybrid Model Routing:** Incorporate a routing/scheduler component (inspired by HERA or similar research[2]) that can allocate subtasks or agent requests to cloud LLMs or local models based on task complexity, privacy, cost, or performance needs.

### **B. Workflow Automation & Integration**

- **Workflow Layer:** Use a visual automation platform (n8n, self-hosted) to connect agents to APIs, SaaS, databases, and business logic. n8n also enables rapid prototyping and non-coder participation.
- **Tooling & RAG:** Integrate with vector databases and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines for knowledge-augmented agents.

### **C. Self-Hosted, Open-Source-First Stack (with Cloud Flexibility)**

- **LLMs:** Deploy open-source models (Llama 3/4, DeepSeek, Qwen, Code Llama) locally for all core AI tasks where feasible, but maintain the option to use Claude Code (cloud) for any agent or workflow segment. The system should make it easy to change agent assignments as needed[1][2][3].
- **Agent Frameworks:** Use open-source orchestration frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, AutoGen) as the backbone for multi-agent workflows, state management, and memory. Extend or wrap as needed for custom logic and model routing.
- **DevOps:** Containerize all components (Docker, Kubernetes) for portability, reliability, and scaling. Use self-hosted CI/CD and monitoring tools for build, deployment, and observability.

## **4. Implementation Strategy**

### **A. Phases**

1. **Design & Planning**
   - Define business objectives, agent roles, and success metrics.
   - Map out core workflows and integration points.
   - Specify which agents will use Claude Code (cloud) and which will use local LLMs initially; design for easy reassignment.

2. **Core Platform Setup**
   - Deploy self-hosted LLMs and vector DBs.
   - Stand up orchestration framework (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen) and MCP protocol layer.
   - Set up n8n for workflow automation and integration.
   - Implement model routing/scheduler logic to direct agent requests to the correct LLM endpoint[2][3][5].

3. **Agent Development**
   - Build specialized agents for each workflow segment, ensuring each can be assigned a cloud or local LLM via configuration.
   - Implement persistent memory and context sharing.
   - Develop agent-to-agent and agent-to-tool communication using MCP.

4. **Integration & Automation**
   - Use n8n to connect agents with business systems, APIs, and external tools.
   - Implement RAG pipelines for knowledge-augmented tasks.

5. **Testing, Monitoring, and Security**
   - Containerize all services and deploy on Kubernetes.
   - Integrate CI/CD, monitoring, and security best practices.
   - Establish human-in-the-loop checkpoints for critical actions.

6. **Iteration & Scaling**
   - Continuously monitor, benchmark, and refine agent performance.
   - Add new agents, tools, and workflows as needed.
   - Gradually migrate agents from cloud LLMs to local models as performance and privacy needs dictate.

---

## **5. Why This Approach?**

- **Ownership & Flexibility:** All critical code, models, and data are self-hosted and open-source where feasible, but you retain the flexibility to use best-in-class cloud LLMs (like Claude Code) where needed. The architecture is designed for seamless switching or hybrid operation[1][2][3].
- **Cost & Privacy Optimization:** Route simpler or less sensitive tasks to local LLMs to save costs and protect data, while reserving cloud LLMs for complex or mission-critical tasks[2].
- **Scalability:** Modular architecture and containerization enable rapid scaling and adaptation as needs evolve.
- **Integration:** n8n and MCP provide seamless connections to business systems, APIs, and future agent ecosystems.
- **Resilience:** Persistent memory and orchestrated recovery ensure agents can resume after failures, supporting production reliability.
- **Extensibility:** The platform is designed for easy addition of new agents, workflows, and integrations as the business grows.

---

## **6. Next Steps**

- Finalize system requirements, agent definitions, and initial LLM assignments (cloud vs. local).
- Select and deploy core frameworks (LangGraph/CrewAI/AutoGen, n8n, MCP).
- Develop initial agent set and core workflows, ensuring model assignment is easily configurable.
- Set up infrastructure (LLMs, vector DBs, CI/CD, monitoring).
- Begin iterative development, integration, and testing, with a roadmap for gradual migration to more local LLM usage as desired.
